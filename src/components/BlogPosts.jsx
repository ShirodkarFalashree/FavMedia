### How We Built a Personal Branding Website in 3 Days

Building a personal branding website in just three days may sound impossible, but with proper planning, teamwork, and clear communication, it can absolutely be done. At **FAVMedia**, we took this challenge head-on when a client needed an urgent online presence for a brand launch.

#### Day 1: Discovery & Wireframing

We kicked off with a discovery call to understand the client’s values, vision, and target audience. From there, we conducted **competitor research** and built a mood board to align on direction. Using **Figma**, our designers created wireframes focused on clarity and user flow.

#### Day 2: Development in Action

Our developers used **Next.js** for optimized performance and **Tailwind CSS** for styling. We incorporated **Framer Motion** for subtle animations and kept the layout mobile-first. Simultaneously, our copywriters crafted engaging bios and calls to action.

#### Day 3: Deployment & SEO

The site was deployed on **Vercel**, with SEO tags and Open Graph metadata in place. Contact forms were powered by Formspree, and **Google Lighthouse** ensured performance standards were met.

**Result**: A clean, fast, SEO-optimized personal website delivered in record time.

### The Art of Editing: Video Content That Converts

In today’s digital world, video isn’t just content—it’s a growth tool. At **FAVMedia**, we transform raw footage into **high-performing marketing assets** that captivate and convert.

#### Define Your Objective

Before editing begins, we help brands clarify: _Are you trying to educate, sell, or entertain?_ This determines tone, pace, and visuals.

#### Building a Narrative

Every video needs a **strong hook**, clear message, and memorable close. We craft structure using branded intros, motion graphics, and on-screen captions.

#### Engagement Through Pacing

Using tools like **Adobe Premiere**, we sync footage with **sound effects** and **licensed music** from Epidemic Sound. Our pacing varies by platform—fast for Reels, measured for YouTube.

#### Polish and Platform-Specific Export

Color grading aligns with your brand palette. We then export multiple formats for platforms like Instagram, LinkedIn, and YouTube.

**Editing is storytelling**—when done right, your audience doesn’t just watch… they act.

### Top 5 Website Animations to Try in 2025

Animations are no longer just “nice-to-have”—they’re a core part of modern UX. Here are **FAVMedia’s top animation picks** for 2025:

1. **Microinteractions**  
   Boost usability with feedback on clicks, hovers, and inputs. Think button pulses, loader spinners, or form validations.

2. **Scroll-Based Animations**  
   Bring content to life as users scroll. Use libraries like **GSAP** or **Framer Motion** to animate elements into view.

3. **Parallax Effects**  
   Create visual depth with background layers that move slower than the foreground. Perfect for storytelling pages.

4. **Page Transitions**  
   Use soft fades or sliding panels between routes in **Next.js** or **React Router** to make the UX smoother.

5. **SVG Path Animations**  
   Animate logos, icons, or line illustrations to build identity and interactivity.

💡 **Pro Tip**: Always prioritize **performance and accessibility**. Use animations to **guide**, not distract.
